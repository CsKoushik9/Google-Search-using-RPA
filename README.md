# Google-Search-using-RPA
RPA means Robotic Process Automation which is used to automate any kind of process we do on system. Here, I have implemented a sample of google search using this concept where the module gets the search as input and it opens the browser and then fetches the result from the google and displays the results in table format for better viewing. This is just a sample of it.

# PROCEDURE FOR INSTALLING AND USING THE MODULE

1. Download the Project from Github as ZIP file.

2. Now extract the project folder in your system.

3. Download XAMPP server from here https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html and install it in C: drive

4. Now Go to C:\xampp\htdocs in your system and paste the google_search folder here.

5. Now Download UiPath software from https://www.uipath.com/developers/community-edition-download.

6. It is absolutely open source software

7. Configure XAMPP server and then start the apache server on port 8081.

8. For configuring apache server on port 8081, Open XAMPP and then Click config near to the apache and you will find 'httpd.conf'. Click      to open that and then search for 'Listen'. Next to the 'Listen' you will find port number, change it to  8081.

9. Now double click on GoogleSearch.xaml it will open in 'UiPath Studio'. If it doesn't open, Open UIPath Studio, and then Click open,        move to the location where the GoogleSearch.xaml file is available. Click on it.

10. Now in UIPath, Click Run and see the output. If any queries contact me on Linkedin or email.
